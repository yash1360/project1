# 🔘 Dynamic Volume Ellipse

A fun UI experiment where a circle grows as you hold down your mouse, reflecting the "volume level." Release to shrink it back. When you go over 100%, you break the matrix. 😎

## 📁 Files
- `vol_button1.html` – HTML structure with circle and icon
- `vol_button1.css` – Styles for layout, circle animation, and text
- `vol_button1.js` – Handles mouse events, growth/shrink logic, and volume calculation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Make sure the `speaker-high-volume-emoji-1024x846-uyk3dkd5.png` image is in the same directory.
3. Open `vol_button1.html` in your browser.

No frameworks, no setup — just click and play!

## ✨ Features
- Click-and-hold interaction to "boost volume"
- Shrinking animation on release
- Dynamic percentage display (with a cheeky twist over 100%)
